## Loading necessary packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Load the dataset

```{r}
ipl_matches <- read.csv("IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv")

```


## Lets take a look at what we have here

```{r}
str(ipl_matches)
```
Lets see first few rows

```{r}
head(ipl_matches,10)
```

Now for the last few matches
```{r}
tail(ipl_matches,10)
```


Lets look at the column names
```{r}
colnames(ipl_matches)
```
## Plotting a graph to see the number of matches won by each team

```{r}
plt <- ggplot(data = ipl_matches) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = fct_infreq(winner), fill = winner))
plot_data <- layer_data(plt)
plt + annotate(geom = "text", label = plot_data$count, x = plot_data$x +5, y = plot_data$y ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yellow","lightblue","#00008B","darkred","orange","red","orange","purple","blue","cyan","#D11D9B","magenta","#D1AB3E","#FF822A","grey")) +
  labs(title = "Number of matches won by each team from 2008-2020", x = "Number of wins", y = "Team") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Team"))
  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean(plot_data$x),colour = "black")
```


## Now lets take a look at the number of loses by each team

```{r}
plt <- ggplot(data = ipl_matches) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = fct_infreq(loser), fill = loser))
plot_data <- layer_data(plt)
plt + annotate(geom = "text", label = plot_data$count, x = plot_data$x +5, y = plot_data$y ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yellow","lightblue","#00008B","darkred","orange","red","orange","purple","blue","cyan","#D11D9B","magenta","#D1AB3E","#FF822A","grey")) +
  labs(title = "Number of matches lost by each team from 2008-2020", x = "Number of loses", y = "Team") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Team"))
```


Lets see which players have been man of the match most number of times
```{r}
ipl_matches %>% 
  count(player_of_match,sort = TRUE,name = "Number of MOTMs") %>% 
  top_n(15)
```

Interesting... ABD who has got the most MOTMs has never won an IPL title along with Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Amit Mishra.



```{r}
ipl_matches %>% 
  count(toss_decision)
```



## Importing another dataset from the same time period(2008-2020) for further analysis

```{r}
ipl_ball_by_ball <- read.csv("IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv")
```


## Inspecting the dataset

```{r}
str(ipl_ball_by_ball)
```

```{r}
colnames(ipl_ball_by_ball)
```


```{r}
head(ipl_ball_by_ball)
```

```{r}
tail(ipl_ball_by_ball)
```

The matches in the data seems to be in order but the overs are not in order.

## Lets try to find some insights from this 

```{r}
  ggplot(data = ipl_ball_by_ball) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = extras_type, fill = extras_type))
```


This graph doesnt work as most of the balls are not extras, so we drop the NAs.

```{r}
ipl_ball_by_ball %>% 
  filter(!is.na(extras_type)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = extras_type,fill = extras_type)) +
  geom_bar()

```

Still the value for penalty seems very small compared to others,lets try labelling it.


```{r}
ipl_ball_by_ball %>% 
  filter(!is.na(extras_type)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = extras_type,fill = extras_type)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = -0.4) +
  labs(title = "Number of extras from 2008-2020", x = "Type of extra", y = "Number of extras") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Type of extra"))
```

And yes, there were 2 penalties.

### Trying to create a circular bar chart of runs scored in each(20) over.


```{r}
over_data <- ipl_ball_by_ball %>% 
  group_by(over) %>% 
  summarise(runs_in_overs = sum(total_runs))

over_data

label_data <- over_data

number_of_bar <- nrow(label_data)

# calculate the ANGLE of the labels
angle <-  90 - 360 * (label_data$over-0.5) /number_of_bar 

# calculate the alignment of labels: right or left
# If I am on the left part of the plot, my labels have currently an angle < -90
label_data$hjust<-ifelse( angle < -90, 1, 0)

# flip angle BY to make them readable
label_data$angle<-ifelse(angle < -90, angle+180, angle)

# Start the plot
p <- ggplot(label_data, aes(x=over, y=runs_in_overs)) +       # Note that id is a factor. If x is numeric, there is some space between the first bar

  # This add the bars with a blue color
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill=alpha("skyblue", 0.9)) +
  
  # Limits of the plot = very important. The negative value controls the size of the inner circle, the positive one is useful to add size over each bar
  ylim(-10000,20000) +
  
  # Custom the theme: no axis title and no cartesian grid
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = unit(rep(-1,14), "cm")      # Adjust the margin to make in sort labels are not truncated!
  ) +
  
  # This makes the coordinate polar instead of cartesian.
  coord_polar(start = 0) +
  
  # Add the labels, using the label_data dataframe that we have created before
  geom_text(data=label_data, aes(x=over, y=runs_in_overs+10, label=over, hjust=hjust), color="black", fontface="bold",alpha=0.6, size=2.5, angle= label_data$angle, inherit.aes = FALSE ) 
 p
```

```{r}
runs_split <- ipl_ball_by_ball %>% 
  group_by(over) %>% 
  summarise(total_batter_runs = sum(batsman_runs), total_extras = sum(extra_runs)) 

runs_split_data <- data.frame(runs_split)
runs_split_data


ggplot(data = runs_split_data, aes(fill=total_batter_runs, y=total_batter_runs, x=over)) + 
    geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity")

ggplot(data = runs_split_data, aes(fill=total_extras, y=total_extras, x=over)) + 
    geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity")
```


```{r}

normalize <- function(x) {
return ((x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)))}

norm_runs_split <- as.data.frame(apply(runs_split_data[2:3], 2, normalize))
norm_runs_split

```



```{r}
overs_data <- ipl_ball_by_ball %>% 
  group_by(over) %>% 
  summarise(runs_in_overs = sum(total_runs))

dataf<- data.frame(overs_data)
dataf

ggplot(dataf,aes(x=over,y=runs_in_overs,fill = over)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ylim(-5000,15000) +
  coord_polar(start=0)
```
